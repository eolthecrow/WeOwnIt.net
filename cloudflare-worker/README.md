# Network & Security Assistant — Cloudflare Worker

This backend is optional. The website chatbox works immediately in local demo mode with no API calls.

To enable real AI responses while staying on Cloudflare's free allowances:

1. Create a free Cloudflare account.
2. Install Node.js, then run `npx wrangler login`.
3. From this directory run `npx wrangler deploy`.
4. Copy the resulting `https://...workers.dev` URL.
5. In `assets/chatbox.js`, set:
   ```js
   window.NETWORK_SECURITY_CHAT_ENDPOINT = "https://YOUR-WORKER.workers.dev";
   ```
   before the chat script initializes, or define the same global in the page before loading `chatbox.js`.

The Worker uses a Workers AI binding named `AI` and the Cloudflare-hosted model:
`@cf/google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it`.

Security included in this starter:
- CORS restricted to the GitHub Pages origin and localhost.
- POST-only chat endpoint.
- 1,200-character user input cap.
- Conversation history capped to the latest six messages.
- No API key is stored in the browser or GitHub Pages frontend.

Before broader public use, add Cloudflare rate limiting / abuse controls and review logging/privacy requirements.
